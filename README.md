YES, these keys are compromised. This was done intentionally to allow our team to test the project with short setup time. :) Please don't try this at home, kids!
### Initialize the project
<pre><code>yarn install
yarn hardhat compile
</code></pre>

### Instructions:

  * Deploy :white_check_mark:

* Publish the project in Github
* Run the scripts with a set of proposals, cast and delegate votes and inspect results
* Write a report detailing the addresses, transaction hashes, description of the operation script being executed and console output from script execution for each step (Deployment, giving voting rights, casting/delegating and querying results).
